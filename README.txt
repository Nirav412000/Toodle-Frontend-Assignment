About Indent and Outdent Functionality:- 
	I have implemented this functionality usind CSS( Margin Property ) with the help of one variable called "Indent". Based on the value of "Indent", we apply Margin to the Division.
	
About Up and Down Functionality:-
	Based on the selected operation, we Swap the selected row with upper row or lower row in the "task" object.
	
About Sava and Load Functionality:-
	I have used LocalStorage which stores Json data in to the file in String Formate and we can convert that string into JSON Object as our need.

For storing the data, Concept of ContextAPI is used that React Offers.
